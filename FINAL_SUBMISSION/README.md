DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

1.Download the source code from the GitHub link above: pollutiondata.sql and cgi-bin, which includes the .py files to run the website 
    2.Start a local CGI server from the directory where the .sql was downloaded.  
  3.Initialize a database using the pollutiondata.sql file.  Edit all four main.py files to your mysql user, password, and database name.  It is inconvenient but we didn’t have time to find another solution to this
  4.Open a browser and navigate to main.py
